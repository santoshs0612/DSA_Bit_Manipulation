Given a non-negative integer N. The task is to check if N is a power of 2. More formally, check if N can be expressed as 2x for some x.

Example 1:

Input: N = 1
Output: YES
Explanation:1 is equal to 2 
raised to 0 (20 = 1).





class Solution{
    public:
    // Function to check if given number n is a power of two.
    bool isPowerofTwo(long long n){
        
        // Your code here   
        return n>0 &&(n&(n-1))==0;
        
    }
};
